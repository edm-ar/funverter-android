            FAHRENHEIT|Fahrenheit bases the boiling point of water at
            212 and the freezing point at 32. Developed by German-born Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit
            in 1714, used primarily in the United States and some Caribbean countries.

            CELSIUS|Celsius represents the freezing point of water at 0 degrees, and 100 degrees
            represents water’s boiling point at the standard atmosphere, which is the mean
            barometric pressure at the mean sea level. Developed by Swedish astronomer Andres Celsius
            in 1742.

            KELVIN|Kelvin represents the freezing point of water at 273.16 kelvins
            and boiling point at 373.16 kelvins. Created by British scientist William Thomson in 1848,
            Kelvin is mostly used in scientific applications because of the lack of negative numbers,
            so it makes it easier to calculate very low temperatures of liquid helium and liquid nitrogen,
            for example.

            RANKINE|Rankine represents the freezing point of water at 491.67°Ra and boiling point at
            671.67°Ra. Created by Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine in 1859.

        <item>REAUMUR|Reaumur represennts the freezing point of water at 0°Ré and boiling point at
            80°Ré. It was invented by French physicist Rene Antoine de Reaumur around 1730.
            This scale is mostly used today in the measuring of milk temperature in cheese production,
            and when cooking sugar syrup for desserts and sweets.

            ACRE|The word acre is derived from Old English aecer originally meaning \"open field\".
            The acre was approximately the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day.
            Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England by acts of Edward I,
            Edward III, Henry VIII, George IV and Queen Victoria.

            ARE|An are is a derived metric SI (System International) measurement unit of area
            used to measure land with sides equal to ten meters (10m). Its multiple, the hectare is
            the principal unit of land measurement for most of the world.

            BARN|Barn, unit of area used to measure the reaction cross section (generally different
            from the geometric cross section) of atomic nuclei and subatomic particles in the study
            of their interactions with other nuclei or particles. It is equal to 10−24 square cm.
            The name, coined by U.S. scientists, is derived from the proverbial phrase
            “side of a barn,” something easy to hit.

            HECTARE|Hectare, unit of area in the metric system equal to 100 ares, or 10,000 square
            metres, and the equivalent of 2.471 acres in the British Imperial System and the
            United States Customary measure. The term is derived from the Latin area and from hect,
            an irregular contraction of the Greek word for hundred. Although the are is the primary
            metric unit of land measurement, in practice the hectare is more commonly used.

            ROOD|The rood was an important measure in surveying on account of its easy conversion
            to acres. When referring to areas, rod is often found in old documents and has exactly
            the same meaning as rood.
